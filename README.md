# vonsim8086
Collection of assembly programs developed for the VonSim simulator (x86-like, 8086 style).   This repository serves as an archive of exercises, old exam solutions, and personal notes from my Computer Engineering studies.   It is intended as a structured reference for practicing low-level programming and experimenting with Von Neumannâ€“style arch.
